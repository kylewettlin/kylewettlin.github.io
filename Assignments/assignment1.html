    <h1>Hello!</h1>

    <p>
        I am currently a student enrolled in UofSC, and I love learning new things.
        In my free time, I enjoy playing videogames, hiking, and cooking for my friends.
        I am a member of the Molinaroli Peer Mentor Program.
        I am also a member of the Gamecock eSports Club.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am also very passionate about video game development.
        I have been drawing and creating 2D Game Art for years.
        I am still working up to my first game release, but it is coming along.
        I hope to one day develop games full time.
    </p>
